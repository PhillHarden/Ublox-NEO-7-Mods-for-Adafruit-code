Adafruit GPS Clock using alternative GPS card
Unable to get an Adafruit GPS card I bought a Ublox Neo-7 gps card and found it gives all the right data out but needs different commands to dissable unwanted 'sentences'. Also ended up dissabling interupts and relied simply on the one output per second from the NEO-7. I now have 3 'slave' clocks via 2.4GHz RF cards. Just the UNO and the Adafeuit 1.2" 7 Segment display and RF.
